Determine whether a rectangle can be formed by giving the four sides. 
Such that length of its sides are a, b, c and d (in any order).

a = float(input("Enter the length of side a: "))
b = float(input("Enter the length of side b: "))
c = float(input("Enter the length of side c: "))
d = float(input("Enter the length of side d: "))
if (a == b and c == d) or (a == c and b == d) or (a == d and b == c):
    print("A rectangle can be formed.")
else:
    print("A rectangle cannot be formed.")
