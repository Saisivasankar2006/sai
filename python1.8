Write a program that accepts the marks in 3 subjects of a student, calculates the average 
mark of the student and prints the student's grade. If the average mark is greater than or equal to 90, then the grade is 'A'. If the average 
mark is 80 and between 80 and 90, then the grade is 'B'. If the average 
mark is 70 and between 70 and 80, then the grade is 'C'. If the average 
mark is 60 and between 60 and 70, then the grade is 'D'. If the average 
mark is 50 and between 50 and 60, then the grade is 'E'. If the average 
mark is less than 50, then the grade is 'F'.

def calculate_grade(mark1, mark2, mark3):
  
    average_mark = (mark1 + mark2 + mark3) / 3
    
    
    if average_mark >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif 80 <= average_mark < 90:
        return 'B'
    elif 70 <= average_mark < 80:
        return 'C'
    elif 60 <= average_mark < 70:
        return 'D'
    elif 50 <= average_mark < 60:
        return 'E'
    else:
        return 'F'

marks = [int(input()) for _ in range(3)]


grade = calculate_grade(*marks)


print("Grade:", grade)
